# EIEE_gene_annotation

This repository contains several scripts used for the EIEE-related gene annotation comparison in the manuscript "Systematic re-annotation of 191 genes associated with early-onset epilepsy unmasks de novo variants linked to Dravet syndrome in novel SCN1A exons" by Steward et al., submitted to Nature Genomic Medicine.

a) Novel exon sequence after gene re-annotation

b) Variants in the novel sequences after gene re-annotation
